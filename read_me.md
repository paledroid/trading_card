# Animal Trading Card Project

This was my first Udacity project on the [Introduction to Programming nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-programming-nanodegree--nd000).

The objective was to create a static web page in HTML and style it using separate but linked CSS. 

## Starter code

Udacity provided starter code, which included a design prototype (template) and instructions to modify it.

If you have access to the Introduction to Programming course at Udacity, you can find a link to the starter code [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd000/parts/d2556581-36ce-4cfa-9965-bd6df219daf4/modules/02bdd87d-f273-40d8-b913-b04b2362cd63/lessons/87257465-644a-4d47-9356-4564eaaf520f/concepts/74228992680923).

## Project Rubric 

The project included a specification and design and code quality critera to meet.

If you have access to the course, the rubric can be found [here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/151/view).

## Udacity style guide

The code was written to align with the [Udacity style guidlines](https://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/).
